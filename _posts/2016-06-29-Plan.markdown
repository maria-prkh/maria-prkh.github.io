 > If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!

                                 Benjamin Franklin

Today it became clear - my idea with this site just dies. And you know why? Because there is no plan and without a plan, there is no fun! There is always a choice for us to be drifted by everyday routine or ...! challenge yourself, create timelines, goals, achieve or fail them bla blah. That being said these smartbooks about the secret of happiness and life planning are written by successful people for lazy asses like me. Hej Benjamin, I've created the project on the [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) with timelines and weekly reminders and you know what - it didn't work! What is next?
