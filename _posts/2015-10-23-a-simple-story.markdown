Hello and welcome! This is not going to be a blog with long stories and exciting words play game. I'm not a talented writer and you are not an attentive listener, your fingers are scrolling faster than my thoughts appear in my head. Whatever it's going to be and whenever it will end, this (the webpage you are currently on) is going to be my experiment. For some reason one day, taking the shower, I've decided I'll create the webpage like this and I'll share the 100 words only and this is going to help me somehow, someday, one day.
